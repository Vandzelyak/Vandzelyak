					<p>I love happy people. I am genuinely passionate about weddings. Details, laughter, quotes and jazz
						music inspire me. It makes me so happy when my brides hug me after the first glimpse of their
						wedding reception. These moments drive me. I adore hand written notes. Love design and executing
						a couple's dreams that they've spent months planning.</p>
					<p>I believe that everyone deserves their dream wedding – simple and chic or luxurious and elaborate
						– I'll be there to make your dream into a reality. It's my job to make every moment and sweet
						detail count.</p>

                            Nucleus created my first website 4 years ago. The customer service and end product blew me
                            away. I never grew tired of looking at my site as it was an excellent representation of my
                            brand. And because of Nucleus’s attention to detail and SEO expertise — my site brought
                            hundreds of prospective customers my way. When it was time to update, Nucleus was my first
                            and only choice. My designer was intuitive, needed very little direction and again exceeded
                            my expectations. The response time was great, communication superb, and deadline met.

                            We hired Denise as a wedding "day" planner she provided an event timelines,  numerous

                            logistical problems you have at a wedding. During the
                            rehearsal she was there on time and ready and on wedding day she was everywhere
                            coordinating with the vendors, making sure the reception decorations were "right" and
                            covering last minute issues. One of Denise's talents is the ability to project a very calm,
                            confident demeanor during a time where things could get high stressed! I would recommend
                            Denise without reservation.

                        <p>But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the <b>famous Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales,</b> in which he gives what he calls a
                            picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never
                            had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is,
                            from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.</p>

                        <p>As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four sailor
                            tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.</p>

                        <p>But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with
                            broken <b>back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself</b> in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his
                            portrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a
                            thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a
                            full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself
                            could not catch.</p>

                        <p>But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little
                            idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal
                            characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as
                            the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones
                            of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as
                            the human fingers in an artificial covering. "However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens."</p>

                        <p>For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another,
                            but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour,
                            is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.</p>

                            characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as
                            the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones
                            of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as
                            the human fingers in an artificial covering. "However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens."</p>

                        <p>For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another,
                            but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour,
                            is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.</p>

                        <p>But these manifold mistakes in depicting <b>the whale are not so very surprising after all.</b> Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship,
                            with broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait.
                            The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast <b>bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched</b> line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing
                            eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown
                            Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not
                            catch.</p>

                        <p>But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a picture
                            of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the
                            benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese
                            drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.</p>

                        <p>As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four sailor
                            tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.</p>

                        <p>But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little
                            idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal
